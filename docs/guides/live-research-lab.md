# Live Research Lab — the research rulebook

The Live Research Lab gives an agent hands, eyes, and a body inside a
running Stargate Worlds session: a client bridge that evaluates Lua and
installs non-freezing hooks on the live `SGW.exe`, a supervisor that owns
the process and merges timelines, and a token-gated in-server endpoint
that reads live entity/witness/packet state. The design is the ADR at
[../architecture/live-research-lab.md](../architecture/live-research-lab.md);
this guide is the **operating manual and the rules of the road**.

The one rule everything else serves:

> **Do not infer client behavior when the running client can answer the
> question.**

If a probe can answer in minutes, a decompilation-only inference is a
draft, not a finding.

## The rulebook

These seven rules expand ADR §7. They apply to every session, local or
colo.

### 1. Ask the running game first

Static analysis produces a hypothesis. A probe produces an answer. If
`client_lua_eval` or a logging hook can confirm the behavior in minutes,
run it before you publish anything derived from Ghidra alone. Inference is
allowed — it is just labeled `inferred` until a probe upgrades it.

### 2. Static finds the *where*, runtime proves the *what*

Ghidra (or x64dbg for single-step work) locates the address, the Lua
global, the message handler. The lab confirms what actually happens there
at runtime. The two are complementary, not competing: never skip the
static step (you need the address), never stop at it (you need the proof).

### 3. Every finding cites its probe

A finding is not done until it records, together:

- the **probe** — the exact Lua chunk or the hook capture spec (address,
  registers/args captured, hit limit, sample rate);
- the **dev-session id** — the id every client and server event was
  tagged with, so the run is findable in SigNoz;
- the **client build** — the SGW.exe build the probe ran against.

A finding without a replayable probe is marked `inferred`. A finding with
one can be re-run by anyone. This is the difference between "we think" and
"we checked".

### 4. Non-freezing hooks only

Logging hooks, never breakpoints. The client's Mercury channel dies if the
main thread stalls past the heartbeat window, and a dead channel means the
server disconnects you — you lose the session you were measuring. Every
lab hook is a log-and-continue trampoline that cannot stall the Tick
drain. Reach for the x64dbg MCP **only** when single-stepping is genuinely
unavoidable, and expect the disconnect when you do.

### 5. Writes and native calls are experiments, not fixes

`client_mem_write` and `client_call_native` exist to *learn* — to prove
that flipping a byte or calling a function produces the effect you
predicted. Nothing that works this way ships as a memory poke. Anything
worth keeping gets re-derived as a launcher patch (client side) or a
server change (server side), with its own test. The lab is the workbench,
not the product.

### 6. On the colo, touch only the lab character and what it spawns

The colo runs with other, non-telemetry players connected. Anything that
reaches beyond your own lab character — `reloadmap`, `respawnall`, a
shutdown, a world-wide content reload — needs the owner's explicit say-so
*in that session*. Spawning an NPC next to your lab character is fine;
anything a stranger three zones away would notice is not. The token does
not enforce this; it is a discipline. (The audit trail does record it —
see "Audit" below.)

### 7. Authored from scratch

AteraLoader and AtreaRL are reference material for how a bridge *can* be
built. They are not code to extend or vendor. Everything in the lab is our
own, so the trust boundary is one we control end to end.

## How to run an experiment

The loop, concretely (ADR §4):

1. **Find a candidate** in Ghidra: an address, a Lua global, a message
   handler. Note the client build.
2. **Place a probe** with `client_hook_install` (a capture spec at the
   address) or `client_lua_eval` (a chunk). No rebuild, no relaunch.
3. **Cause the behavior.** Drive it from the real client body: a slash
   command via `client_console`, a Lua call into the UI, or a server-side
   `server_console_exec` — e.g. spawn a mob beside the lab character.
4. **Read what happened.** `lab_timeline` for the merged client+server
   window (below), `lab_screenshot` for the eyes, `server_packet_tap_read`
   / `server_witnesses` / `server_entity_get` for the server's view.
5. **Write it up** with the probe, the dev-session id, and the client
   build (rule 3). Then re-derive anything worth keeping as a patch or a
   server change (rule 5).

### Reading the merged timeline

`lab_timeline` interleaves local client events with server packet-tap
rows on **one clock**. Client events (bridge heartbeat today; the full
hook-hit / Lua-print / Mercury-dispatch ring once #686 lands) arrive on
the dev-box clock; packet-tap rows arrive on the server clock. The
supervisor estimates the offset between the two from the packet-tap round
trip and projects the client events onto the server clock, so a client
observation and the packet that caused it line up.

Call it with the server session whose tap you want merged in:

```jsonc
// tool: lab_timeline
{
  "session_id": "<the lab character's session>",  // omit for client-only
  "window_ms": 30000,                              // lookback; default 60000
  "limit": 1000                                    // tap-row cap; default 1000
}
```

The result carries the estimated `offset` (with its RTT and method), the
resolved `window`, and the ordered `events`. Each event says whether it is
`client` or `server` sourced, its `server_ts_ms` (the merge key), the
original `client_ts_ms` for client events, and a `kind`
(`bridge.heartbeat`, `mercury.<name>`, …).

`lab_timeline` is the **low-latency local read**. SigNoz remains the
durable copy under the dev-session id — use SigNoz for anything you need
to keep or share; use `lab_timeline` for the fast inner loop.

> **Today vs. later.** The client side of the timeline is currently the
> bridge heartbeat ring — enough to answer "did the client's main thread
> keep ticking while the server sent packet X". The rich client-event ring
> (`client_events_read`, #686) was stopped by the owner; when it lands it
> plugs into the same offset/merge machinery with no downstream change.
> Until then, `lab_timeline` is useful but heartbeat-only on the client
> side, and the clock offset is a coarse estimate from the packet-tap
> round trip (there is no dedicated server ping tool yet).

### The free Lua-VM check (SigNoz Q1)

Before you build any autologin probe, answer the open question from the
#685 spike — **is the Lua VM alive at the login screen?** — for free, with
no new probe. The client already emits a `client.lua.newstate` event when
the Lua state is created, and it ships to SigNoz under your dev-session id.
Query it:

- **Signal:** Logs (or Traces).
- **Filter:** `deploy.dev_session_id = <your session>` AND
  `body CONTAINS 'client.lua.newstate'` (or the event name field, if your
  build tags it as an attribute).
- **Read:** the timestamp of the first `client.lua.newstate` relative to
  the login-screen render tells you whether the VM exists before or only
  after character select. If it fires at the login screen, Lua-driven
  autologin is viable; if not, autologin falls back to synthesized input
  until the VM appears.

This is the pattern for the whole lab: the cheapest probe is often a query
against telemetry you are already emitting.

## Tools at a glance

Supervisor (`cimmeria-lab`, stdio MCP on the dev box):

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lab_client_start` / `_stop` / `_restart` | Own the SGW.exe lifecycle. |
| `lab_client_status` | PID, uptime, heartbeat age, login state, crashes. |
| `lab_login` | Autologin the lab account, enter the world. |
| `lab_screenshot` | Window capture by PID → MCP image. |
| `lab_crash_report` | Last minidump, last N commands, quarantined command. |
| `lab_timeline` | Merged client+server window (above). |
| `client_lua_eval` / `client_module_info` / `client_mem_read` | Probe tools proxied to the bridge. |

Server endpoint (`cimmeria-lab-mcp`, in-server, token-gated HTTP —
WireGuard-only on the colo): `server_console_*`, `server_sessions`,
`server_entity_*`, `server_witnesses`, `server_packet_tap_*`,
`server_log_tail`, `server_content_reload`, `server_db_query`. See ADR
§3.5 for the full set; `docs/operations/colo-deploy.md` for the port.

## Trust, audit, and the colo

- **Activation is double-gated.** The bridge code exists only in a
  telemetry DLL built `--features lab-bridge` (off by default), and even
  then starts only when `current-session.json` carries a `lab` block that
  only the supervisor writes. A DLL handed to anyone else physically lacks
  the bridge.
- **No server→client command relay exists.** The agent drives the client
  from the same box as the client. Other players' clients are unreachable
  by construction.
- **Fail-closed server endpoint.** `cimmeria-lab-mcp` starts only when
  both `CIMMERIA_LAB_MCP_BIND` and `CIMMERIA_LAB_MCP_TOKEN` are set, with
  a token of at least 32 bytes. Absent env = endpoint absent.
- **Audit is the log trail.** Every server-endpoint tool call emits one
  `info` event on `lab.tool_call` (tool, arguments, caller, outcome),
  which reaches SigNoz through the existing exporter. On the colo, that
  log line is the whole audit trail per the owner's decision — which is
  why rule 6 matters.

## Setup

The lab is wired into `.mcp.json` alongside Ghidra and x64dbg — see
[re-toolchain-setup.md](re-toolchain-setup.md) for the entries and the env
vars, and [reverse-engineering-with-claude.md](reverse-engineering-with-claude.md)
for where the lab sits in the RE workflow (the "ask the running game"
path). Lab-account credentials live in
`<install>/Binaries/sessions/lab-account.json`, gitignored.
