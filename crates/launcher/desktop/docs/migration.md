# Legacy launcher import

The native `DesktopState` import API preserves a legacy launcher's identity,
configuration and historical patch ledger in app-data. It does not establish
content ownership or install/launch readiness. Updater migration and installed
update/launch parity are separate work; this does not complete packet 8.

## Native integration

Use `storage::migration::{LegacySource, LegacyImport, MigrationError}`.
`LegacySource` contains native-selected `launcher_directory` (the folder beside
the old executable) and `game_directory` (the game root). Both must exist and be
absolute. This explicit mapping accommodates a Windows config path on Mac;
the original `config.install_path` is retained separately and displayed during
confirmation. Do not silently infer a Windows-to-Mac path conversion.

1. Call `DesktopState::preview_legacy_import(&source)` under the command mutex.
   Show source folders, original install path, identity, configuration and the
   ordered ledger. Explain that historical/adopted claims are unverified.
2. Require a visible user confirmation. Pass the returned `confirmation` digest
   and current preferences revision to `import_legacy(&source, &digest, revision)`.
   The engine rereads all three sources under the legacy process lock and rejects
   changed bytes. A changed source requires a fresh preview and confirmation.
3. Refresh preferences and `legacy_import()` after success. Exact repeated imports
   are idempotent, including a response lost after commit. Different imports
   conflict; the engine never replaces the saved identity.

Registration requires `pub mod migration` in `storage/mod.rs` and calling
`state.recover_legacy_import()?` in `DesktopState::open` after construction and
before returning it. No new dependency is required. Shell IPC and frontend
confirmation presentation are owned by the integration packet, not this module.

## Sources and consent

All three files are required: executable-adjacent `launcher-config.json` and
`install.json`, plus game-root `launcher-installed.json`. Config versions 1, 2
and absent-version schema 1 are accepted; identity schema 1 is required.
Missing, malformed, newer-schema, nonregular and oversized sources fail closed.
Each source is limited to 12 KiB and the final record to the existing 64 KiB
storage limit. Large valid imports report `too_large` without changing sources.

The record retains exact UTF-8 source bytes, including whitespace and unknown
fields. Typed views preserve identity metadata, explicit config values, login
servers, DLL override/patch settings, ordered duplicate patch IDs, seed claim and
`seed_adopted`. Missing legacy fields get the old loader's defaults. Unlike the
old schema-1 loader, import does not rewrite the user's telemetry auth URL.

Only `telemetry.opted_in` preserves game telemetry consent. Historical `enabled`
is ignored as consent. Launcher-summary consent is independent: the current
value remains unchanged, including the default false. Import sends nothing and
starts no telemetry service.

## Persistence and coexistence

Preview and import acquire an exclusive OS lock on the actual executable-adjacent
`launcher.lock`. Import holds it through durable completion. An active legacy
launcher returns `busy`. The lock file is retained; it is never unlinked or
truncated. Preview may create it, but never rewrites source JSON.

`legacy-import.json` is an atomic transaction record containing exact source
bytes, typed values, source digest, previous and intended preferences, and a
completion flag. The engine first persists this record, then changes the selected
game folder with a preference revision increment, then marks completion. It never
creates `installed-content.json`, an install intent, or a signed content receipt.
An existing desktop receipt or operation history blocks first-time import.

If replacement is uncertain, or a later transaction step fails, mutations require
reopening. Startup validates the saved record and completes only the exact saved
preference transition while holding the legacy lock. Recovery uses archived
bytes; subsequent changes to source JSON cannot change an admitted transaction.
A divergent preferences record fails closed. A completed import does not overwrite
later preference changes. Windows power-loss durability still needs native proof.

The legacy ledger alone exposes no uninstall target and cannot authorize Repair,
destructive replacement or launch. The import lock guards this transaction only;
any future workflow operating legacy game files must establish its own ownership
and coexistence contract.

## Verification boundaries

The engine fixtures cover schema variants, defaults, exact byte and metadata
preservation, consent separation, ledger ordering, stale revisions, source edits,
conflicting imports, corruption/missing/oversized files, symlinks, idempotence,
reopen, failures before/after atomic replacement, interrupted preference and
completion writes, and absent destructive ownership. A Unix subprocess holding
`flock` verifies real cross-process contention against the legacy lock primitive.
Windows-native lock interoperability, hardware power-loss durability, shell/UI
confirmation, visual UAT and actual legacy-user installs remain unverified here.
